        <div class="raidguidetext">
          <p>For this fight the raid will need two tanks. The main tank takes Lucifron and turns him away from the raid. The offtank will take both Flamewaker Protector, bring them next to Lucifron and also turn them away from the raid, while also facing them slightly away from the Main tank. This allows the Main tank to avoid <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20605/cleave">Cleave</a>.</p>
          <p>Once in position the dps needs to start attacking the two Flamewaker Protector to reduce the amount of <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20604/dominate-mind">Dominate Mind</a>. If the enemies are stacked properly, your raid will also be able to cleave the boss at the same time. However, when <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20604/dominate-mind">Dominate Mind</a> does occur, the raid will need to hold back on their AoE till the mind controlled teammate is dispelled. It is very easy to accidentally kill a raid member during this mind control! To avoid any healers or ranged dps getting mind controlled, make sure they are all further than 20 yards away.</p>
          <p>The final two abilities the raid has to be prepared for are unavoidable. These abilities are <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19702/impending-doom">Impending Doom</a> and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19703/lucifrons-curse">Lucifron's Curse</a>. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19702/impending-doom">Impending Doom</a> can be mitigated with shadow resistance buffs, such as <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=27683/prayer-of-shadow-protection">Prayer of Protection</a>. To reduce the damage even further, consumables such as <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13459/greater-shadow-protection-potion">Greater Shadow Protection Potion</a> can be used. Most often times raiders will find themselves not using their potion cooldowns for <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13459/greater-shadow-protection-potion">Greater Shadow Protection Potion</a> and opt to simply soak that damage so that they can use <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion">Restorative Potion</a> to immediately remove <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19703/lucifrons-curse">Lucifron's Curse</a>. Using this potion not only saves you valuable mana/rage/energy, but also saves your healers or mages time and mana by not having to cleanse the curse off of every single raid member.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="raidguidetext">
          <p>Compared to Lucifron, Magmadar has much more damage that needs to be healed. Magmadar can be tanked right where he stands. The only time the Main Tank needs to move him is if drops a <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19411/lava-bomb">Lava Bomb</a> on the tank, or drops multiple on the melee dps, leaving them no space to safely hit him. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19411/lava-bomb">Lava Bomb</a> can also target a players from a range. This means that as a ranged dps or healer you must move out of the patch of fire as soon as you are targeted to avoid continuous fire damage! Melee also will need consistent healing on this fight since they will all have <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19450/magma-spit">Magma Spit</a> applied to them, stacking up to three times. For this reason, the raid will want strong AoE healing. To help mitigate damage, it is important to use fire resistance buffs and consumables. Such as, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19900/fire-resistance-aura">Fire Resistance Aura</a>/ <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10538/fire-resistance-totem">Fire Resistance Totem</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12455/juju-ember">Juju Ember</a>, and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13457/greater-fire-protection-potion">Greater Fire Protection Potion</a>. Melee will not only be taking fire damage, but will also occasionally get feared when Magmadar uses <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19408/panic">Panic</a>. Warriors are able to use <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18499/berserker-rage">Berserker Rage</a> to cancel this fearing effect. Alliance will also have <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=6346/fear-ward">Fear Ward</a> from Dwarf Priests. Luckily, as a healer or ranged dps, you can out range this fear by standing max distance from the boss. Lastly, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19451/frenzy">Frenzy</a> can be extremely dangerous for your main tank. Luckily Lucifron will drop <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16665/tome-of-tranquilizing-shot">Tome of Tranquilizing Shot</a>. Allowing your Hunters to nullify this effect.</p>

        <div class="raidguidetext">
          <p>Gehennas typically requires two tanks and is tanked similarly to Lucifron. Ideally, one tank holds both of the Flamewaker adds next to Gehennas while facing them away from the raid. During the duration of the fight Gahennas will cast <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19717/rain-of-fire">Rain of Fire</a> on a random raid member. Often times, the Rain of Fire will be on top of the melee dps or tanks. Tanks should adjust their positions accordingly, moving both the boss and his guards to a safe area, out of <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19717/rain-of-fire">Rain of Fire</a>. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19716/gehennas-curse">Gehennas' Curse</a> is an ability cast on all raid members periodically during the boss encounter. Since your mages and healers can only decurse several people at a time, it is important that they prioritize decursing the tanks first. Followed by melee dps. More ideally, like Lucifron, nonmelee raid members should be bringing a <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion">Restorative Potion</a> to immidiatly cleanse the curse themselves. The last mechanic that needs to be addressed is <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20277/fist-of-ragnaros">First of Ragnaros</a>. This ability will hit anyone in melee near the boss. Typically hitting all of the melee and tank. To remedy this stun, tanks and melee use <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5634/free-action-potion">Free Action Potion</a> for their potion cooldown instead of <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion">Restorative Potion</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="raidguidetext">
          <p>Compared to some of the other bosses, Garr very simple mechanics. However, that does not mean he is an easy boss to kill! Garr is a tank and healer check. Tanks take significant damage in this encounter. Both Garr and his adds hit quite hard. Especially if the offtank is tanking multiple adds, while soaking the occassional <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19497/eruption">Eruption</a>. For this boss the Main Tank will tank the boss where he stands. The offtanks grab the Firesworn adds, tanking them just barely over 15 yards away from Garr and caster group (remember not to go too far though or you will trigger the Separation Anxiety ability. This removes the chance of anyone getting hit by <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19497/eruption">Eruption</a> other than the offtank. At later stages of Classic Wow when your tanks have more health and armor, a tank can hold all of the Firesworn by themself while using defensive cooldowns such as <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=871/shield-wall">Shield Wall</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12975/last-stand">Last Stand</a>, and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13455/greater-stoneshield-potion">Greater Stoneshield Potion</a>. While progressing through Molten Core, guilds can choose the safer strategy by having warlocks dedicated to casting <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18647/banish">Banish</a> on Firesworn. Having each warlock on a designated firesworn, leaving the offtank to pick up the rest. Once the boss and adds are in position or banished your raid has two options. One is safer than the other.</p>
          <p>Safe kill: Assign a skull to one Firesworn at a time, picking off each add one at a time while your Main tank is tanking Garr at least 15-18 yards away from the raid. After all the adds are dead, including the ones banished by the warlocks, the raid can safely burn Garr down. This method is less dangerous, allowing your offtank to slowly take less and less damage.</p>
          <p>Difficult kill: The offtank tanks all of the Firesworn while the raid nukes Garr. This means that the offtank will not only be taking a barrage of hits from all of the Firesworn and also tanking the occassional <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19497/eruption">Eruption</a> which happens when Garr is under 50% health. After Garr is dead, the ranged dps picks off the remaining Firesworn, AoE'ing till they are all low hp, then killing them one by one since they still cast <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19497/eruption">Eruption</a> upon death.</p>

          <p> <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19695/inferno">Inferno</a> and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20475/living-bomb">Living Bomb</a> are the two main mechanics to this boss fight. First let us go over <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20475/living-bomb">Living Bomb</a>. This ability will target a random member in your raid giving them a debuff that literally turns them into a ticking time bomb, exploding after 8 seconds knocking the player into the air. To handle this mechanic the raid will want the ranged and healers to be stacked. Once someone is designated to be the bomb, they run away from the stacked raid group and hug the walls of the cavern. This not only ensures that the bomb will not explode on the whole raid, but will often times minimize fall damage the player takes after exploding if they position themselves well on the cavern wall. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19695/inferno">Inferno</a> is a heavy AoE fire damage ability Baron Geddon channels every so often. Lasting 8 seconds. During this time melee dps will simply need to run away from the boss to avoid taking massive amounts of damage. The tank however, is able to stay the inferno soaking the damage as long as the raid's healers are all able to focus healing on them. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19659/ignite-mana">Ignite Mana</a> will hinder your healers' and casters' mana usage, draining their mana in significant chunks every 3 seconds. To remedy this, Priests will need to focus on using <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=988/dispel-magic">Dispel Magic</a> on all of their raid's mana users. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion">Restorative Potion</a> can also be used to remove this magic effect. Finally, the least important ability, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20478/armageddon">Armageddon</a>. This is a self destruct sort of ability the boss will use once he is low hp. If your raid cannot kill him before he is done channeling this ability, he will explode and kill the raid along with himself. Luckily, it is not difficult to burn through this phase.</p>

      <div class="cardguide">
        <div class="raidpic">
          <img src="Shazzrah.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <div class="raidguidetext">
          <p>Shazzrah is all about timing and positioning. Knowing when each ability is going to be used is vital. Let's go over the frequency of these abilities first. Lucifron casts <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19712/arcane-explosion">Arcane Explosion</a> 4 seconds into the encounter and in a 4 second time interval till he has been defeated. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19715/counterspell">Counterspell</a> is an AoE ability effecting all raid members and is cast 15 seconds into the encounter, continuing in a 15 second time interval. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19714/deaden-magic">Deaden Magic</a> is a buff that Shazzrah will cast on himself every 5 seconds. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19713/shazzrahs-curse">Shazzrah's Curse</a> is a debuff that will effect every raid member and is casted by Shazzrah in a 10 second time interval. <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=28391/blink">Blink</a> can be cast by as early as every 25 seconds (from the previous cast or from the initial pull). This ability is not always cast precisely when it is able to be cast, meaning this ability can come sometimes be cast several seconds past the 25 second mark.</p>
          <p>Now that we know how often Shazzrah's abilities are cast, let's talk about the strategy to defeat him! The ranged dps and healers will need to spread out around the boss, staying max distance away from the boss while still being in range of the boss or teammates to dps or heal. Once the boss is pulled, timers will start for all of his abilities. Luckily, if the ranged dps and healers stay far enough away from the boss <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19712/arcane-explosion">Arcane Explosion</a> will only hit melee players. 5 seconds after pulling Shazzrah will recieve the buff <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19714/deaden-magic">Deaden Magic</a>, which needs to be dispelled right away by any Priest in the raid group in order to have optimal dps for your raid's casters. The next ability the boss will cast will be Shazzrah's Curse which will leave a debuff on every raid member. Mages and Druids will need to use <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2782/remove-curse">Remove Curse</a> immidiatly on the raid members. Prioritizing tanks, then melee dps, then finally ranged dps and healers. 15 seconds after the initial pull the boss will use his next ability, a mass <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19715/counterspell">Counterspell</a>. If any caster is caught casting a spell when this ability goes off then they will be locked out of that school of magic for 10 seconds. That means that if healers are caught by this ability, they will not be able to heal up the raid for a whole 10 seconds! To avoid being locked out of your spells have all spellcasters stop casting 1-2 seconds before this ability goes off. The last and possibly most dangerous ability is <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=28391/blink">Blink</a>. Shazzrah will target a specific raid member and teleport to them, wiping all threat and continuing to cast <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19712/arcane-explosion">Arcane Explosion</a>. This is why the ranged dps and healers are spread out. So that they mitigate the amount of AoE damage Shazzrah is able to produce after a teleport. It is also very important for all raid members to NOT dps immidiatly after a teleport so that the tank may regain their threat while repositioning the boss.</p>

        <div class="raidguidetext">
          <p> This boss requires 3 tanks. One tank to hold both of the corehound adds and the other two tanks take care of Golemagg. The reason this boss needs two tanks just for himself is due to his ability <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13880/magma-splash">Magma Splash</a>. Whenever the boss is hit by melee damage he has a chance to apply a stack of this debuff. Not only does <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13880/magma-splash">Magma Splash</a> increase the fire damage the target takes per stack, but also reduces armor. due to this reason tanks will need to take turns taking this boss. The add tank should engage the fight using AoE threat generating abilities to make sure both dogs focus them, then dragging both dogs off to the side. Immidiatly after the add tank engages, the main tank will taunt Golemagg off before the add tank drags the dogs away, tanking Golemagg where he stands. During this time the third tank waits idle by waiting for the main tank to have 5-6 stacks of <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13880/magma-splash">Magma Splash</a>. Once the main tank has 5-6 stacks the third tank will taunt Golemagg and tank him in the same position till recieving 5-6 stacks of <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13880/magma-splash">Magma Splash</a>. The tanks continue to alternate tanking the boss till the fight has been complete. NOTICE: melee dps will generate stacks of <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13880/magma-splash">Magma Splash</a> as well! Although the armor reduction does not matter much as a dps class, they will also take increasing amounts of fire damage. Melee will need to stop attacking the boss once the damage becomes too much for your guild's healer team to manage. Golemagg's second ability <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20228/pyroblast">Pyroblast</a> targets a raid member at random occassionaly throughout the encounter. Watch for members hit by this and heal them up!</p>

      <div class="cardguide">
        <div class="raidpic">
          <img src="Sulfuron.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <div class="raidguidetext">
          <p>Sulfuron Harbinger is another boss that requires multiple tanks. This boss will also need assigned interrupts for each of the Flamewaker Priest for when they cast <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19775/dark-mending">Dark Mending</a>. Like Garr, this boss has a safe, easy, and slow strategy or a quick, dangerous, and difficult strategy that often times will require a bit more gear to perform succussfully.</p>
          <h3>Safe Method:</h3>
          <p>Have 5 warriors equip tank gear and assign lesser geared tanks to tanking an assigned Flamewaker Priest. Leaving the main tank to engage Sulfuron Harbinger. The main tank pulls Sulfuron Harbinger to the back side of the room while the add tanks bring each of their targets away from Sulfuron Harbinger. Remember to send a couple of healers along with the main tank to the back side of the room. From here, the raid marks one Flamewaker Priest as a skull and focuses that target down. Continue marking one Flamewaker Priest as the kill target till all have been killed. Remember that your assigned interrupts are canceling all casts of <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19775/dark-mending">Dark Mending</a>. Last, have all dps focus Sulfuron Harbinger and the fight is over! Keep in mind <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19780/hand-of-ragnaros">Hand of Ragnaros</a> has a 10 yard radius. To remedy this, all melee dps or anyone else within this radius should use <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5634/free-action-potion">Free Action Potion</a> to avoid the stunning effect of <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19780/hand-of-ragnaros">Hand of Ragnaros</a> for 30 seconds.</P>
          <p>This method does not give Sulfuron the chance to cast <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19779/inspire">Inspire</a> on his adds and also keeps your raid members out of range of any <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19780/hand-of-ragnaros">Hand of Ragnaros</a> casts that may go off while focusing his adds.</p>
          <h3>Advanced Method:</h3>
          <p>This method requires only 2 tanks. Have one tank start the encounter by using <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19779/inspire">Challenging Shout</a> and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19779/inspire">Greater Stoneshield Potion</a> at the same time, with the second tank immidiatly using <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19779/inspire">Taunt</a> on Sulfuron Harbinger. After the Flamewaker Priest tank uses Challenging Shout and Greater Stoneshield Potion they will want to follow up with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19779/inspire">Shield Wall</a>, keeping <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19779/inspire">Last Stand</a> as a backup. Following the defensive cooldowns the Flamewaker Priest tank will need to generate as much AoE threat as possible (for suggestions on AoE threat please refer to:<a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-warrior-pve-tanking">https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-warrior-pve-tanking</a>). Tanking the encounter with this method allows for all of the enemies to be stacked up, letting the raid do massive amounts of AoE damage with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20569/cleave">Cleave</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=1680/whirlwind">Whirlwind</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=8423/flamestrike">Flamestrike</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10646/goblin-sapper-charge">Goblin Sapper Charge</a>, and so on (melee will still want to use <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5634/free-action-potion">Free Action Potion</a> to avoid the stunning effect of Hand of Ragnaros for 30 seconds). This method will still need at least one person assigned to interrupt each <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19775/dark-mending">Dark Mending</a> cast from Flamewaker Priest.</p>
          <p>A strategy like this heavily depends on how much AoE damage the raid can do and if the tank holding all of the Flamewaker Priest can live. This means that this method relies on the raid having a considerable amount of gear. However, to make this strategy a bit easier you can assign two tanks to handle the adds. Splitting it evenly, leaving two Flamewaker Priest for each.</p>

        <div class="raidguidetext">
          <p>Majordomo Executus requires a minimum of three tanks. One tank for Majordomo Executus himself and offtanks to hold two adds each. Majordomo Executus can be initiated with a paladin using Blessing of Protection on themselves to pull, giving tanks time to take their designated mobs, or a hunter starting the fight with its pet. Both methods also include mages having designated <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12826/polymorph">Polymorph</a> assigned for each Flamewaker Healer.</p>
          <p>After the boss is pulled, the two offtanks will grab their two assigned Flamewaker Elite, bringing them together for the raid to AoE down (Note: If 2 Flamewaker Elite is too much for offtanks to handle, then two more warriors can equip shields to split the Flamewaker Elite up to one tank each). Mages need to make sure to keep their designated Flamewaker Healer polymorphed till each Flamewaker Elite is dead. After the elites have died, continue to dps each healer one by one till the fight is over.</p>
          <p>During the whole encounter Majordomo will give all of his adds a random buff of either <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20620/aegis-of-ragnaros">Aegis of Ragnaros</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=21075/damage-shield">Damage Shield</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20619/magic-reflection">Magic Reflection</a>. The first two abilities simply need to be healed through. However, the last ability, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20619/magic-reflection">Magic Reflection</a> can kill a caster in one hit if that player were to crit! For this reason it is imperative that all casters stop damaging their target when <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20619/magic-reflection">Magic Reflection</a> is up.
          <p>Last but not least, throughout the fight a random player will be selected for the <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20619/magic-reflection">Magic Reflection</a> ability. Putting them in the center of the molten rocks, causing fire damage till they run out.</p>

        <div class="raidguidetext">
          <p>Ragnaros requires a minimum of two tanks that have a good set of fire resistance gear, pushing the cap of 315 with full buffs. To help reach reach this resistance tanks should utilize things like <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19900/fire-resistance-aura">Fire Resistance Aura</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10538/fire-resistance-totem">Fire Resistance Totem</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12455/juju-ember">Juju Ember</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=21850/gift-of-the-wild">Gift of the Wild</a>, and various fire resistance pieces of armor such as Dark Iron armor from Thorium Brotherhood reputation. In addition, it is recommended that all members use <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13457/greater-fire-protection-potion">Greater Fire Protection Potion</a> on this boss encounter to minimize raid damage taken.</p>
          <p>Before starting the encounter the raid will want to spread out the ranged dps and healers around the platforms surrounding the center of the room stacking in pairs of two. Each pair of two needs to be spread a minimum of 10 yards apart from each other. Positioning in this way is important because Ragnaros casts <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19780/hand-of-ragnaros">Hand of Ragnaros</a> throughout the encounter. Minimizing the amount of players knocked back by each use of this spell is important. Remember to make sure your healers can cover all raid members while spreading out!</p>
          <p>Ragnaros requires two tanks because he must have one person within melee range at all times. If he doesn't, he will immidiatly start casting <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20565/magma-blast">Magma Blast</a> on raid members at random. Staying in melee range can be difficult since Ragnaros periodically casts <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20566/wrath-of-ragnaros">Wrath of Ragnaros</a>. This ability will knock back everyone within 25 yards of Ragnaros. A few seconds before Ragnaros uses this ability the raid's melee dps will all want to back away from the boss to avoid taking damage. Unlike the melee dps, the tank is not allowed to back away from the ability. If they do, Ragnaros will go back to casting <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20565/magma-blast">Magma Blast</a>. This is where the second tank comes in. When one tank is knocked away by <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20566/wrath-of-ragnaros">Wrath of Ragnaros</a> the next tank needs to immidiatly run into melee range to engage Ragnaros.</P>
          <p>3 minutes after the start of the encounter Ragnaros will submerge underneath the lava making him untargetable. This is when the adds Son of Flame will spawn. These adds do not do large amounts of damage, but it is very important that they are kept away from your raid's casters. Especially healers. This is because of their ability <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=21858/lava-shield">Lava Shield</a> that will drain mana from all users within 10 meters. Luckily, the Son of Flame are susceptible to crowd controlling effects. Make sure your raid uses <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18647/banish">Banish</a>, <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10230/frost-nova">Frost Nova</a>, and well positioned <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13809/frost-trap">Frost Trap</a> to control adds. After all of the Son of Flame have died Ragnaros will reemerge. The raid will need to reposition for Ragnaros when there is one add left to kill.</p>
          <p>Follow these guidelines till Ragnaros has fallen and your team has claimed victory!</p>
