          <p><h2 style="text-align: center">GUILD MASTERS</h2></p>
          <p>GUILD MASTERS are the Leaders and living engine of the MISCERS Guild. We have worked closely together for the last 6 months; creating, organising and preparing this dream and believe we have created something truly unique. All will be revealed very soon™.</p>
          <p>As ambassadors we are deeply committed to uphold the values of the guild and it’s members, acting in as fair and transparent manner as possible.</p>
          <p>We are at the service of the Guild and its members.</p>
          <p>Guilds cannot be organised solely by GUILD MASTERS themselves, so we have built some trusty ladies and gentlemen to help us along our journey.</p>
          <p><h2 style="text-align: center">OFFICERS</h2></p>
          <p>OFFICERS are the GM's right hand hench-men, they will assist in building the guild and it’s members acting as it’s eyes and ears (no stalker).</p>
          <p>OFFICERS will be responsible for unique, challenging and rewarding roles within the guild. If you are interested in an officer role please see our Discord Guild Section.</p>
          <p><h2 style="text-align: center">CLASS OFFICERS</h2></p>
          <p>CLASS OFFICERS are experienced Classic WoW players, they are trustworthy, and understand the mechanics of the class they are playing and the members they are managing.</p>
          <p>CLASS OFFICERS are here to look over their respective class members, ensuring they are following their duties, and maximise their potential.</p>
          <p>CLASS OFFICERS are expected to grade each of their respective members each week which will then translate the combined data into the PERFORMANCE sheet, to the left of this text column.</p>
          <p><h1 style="text-align: center">LOOT</h1></p>
          <p><h2 style="text-align: center">ROTATING LOOT COUNCIL</h2></p>
          <p>The Guild will be operating and raiding under Loot Council rules.</p>
          <p>We believe Loot Council if ran fairly and transparently is the best form of guild and raid distribution methods to aid in the progression of the Guild as a whole.</p>
          <p>LOOT COUNCIL will be chosen every week on reset from a random number generator from 2 pools of guild members:</p>
          <P>3 OFFICERS and 2 GUILD MEMBERS</p>
