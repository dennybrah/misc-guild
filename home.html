            <p>Thank you very much to everyone who came out and provided the testing we were hoping for! Thanks to you, we’ve been able to fine-tune our plans for launch, and we even captured a few issues that we were able to solve yesterday.</p>
            <p>We’ll see you in Azeroth!</p>

            <p>Internally, we’re working through the aforementioned bug fixes, testing the high-level zones such as Eastern Plaguelands, and doing our raid testing. We’ll make sure Ragnaros and Onyxia are ready to go.</p>

        <p>We are a bunch of semi-degenerates excited to be back for classic. We came from a message board, which revolves around lifting weights. A lot of us have been around for a few vanilla private servers and of course vanilla retail. We have a good mix of experienced, and not so experienced players, but provide the resources and help to get up to speed if need be.</p>
        <p>We have been recruiting players who are chill, looking to have a good time, while also looking to push content at a nice quick, healthy pace. We aren’t trying to min max to the extreme, but we also want to do well when pushing content and having a positive heck of a time while doing it.</p>
        <p>We are looking for more class leaders, and other possible leadership roles to fill, if anyone is interested.</p>
        <p>We also plan on having a lot of pvp premades and wpvp events. We will definitely be making the alliance on our server wish they weren't alliance any longer.</p>
        <p>We are looking looking for players that may or may not have experience, but are willing to put in effort to listen and follow direction, and most importantly, are here to have a good time. If that fits for you, it fits for us.</p>
