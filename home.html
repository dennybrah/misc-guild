            <p>We have now reached a stage where WoW Classic is in a good state for reconciling remaining issues, and we intend to shift our focus away from the closed beta, which will end on July 12.</p>
            <p>Internally, we’re working through the aforementioned bug fixes, testing the high-level zones such as Eastern Plaguelands, and doing our raid testing. We’ll make sure Ragnaros and Onyxia are ready to go.</p>
            <p>Thank you!
          </div>
        <p>Next up, we have a stress test scheduled for July 25th and 26th which everyone will be able to participate, as long as you have a subscription for WoW play time.</p>
        <p>After this stress test, we will be in hype-mode till launch on August 26th.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <p>We are a bunch of semi-degenerates excited to be back for classic. We have a larger community outside of the wow classic player base that lift weights, essentially where we come from. A group of us have been around for a few vanilla private servers. A lot of us have experience from vanilla, private servers, and retail.</p>
        <p>We have been recruiting players who are chill, looking to have a good time, while also looking to push content at a nice quick, healthy pace. We aren’t trying to min max to the extreme, but we also want to do well when pushing content.</p>
        <p>We are also looking for more class leaders, and other possible leadership roles to fill, if anyone is interested.</p>
        <p>We also plan on having a lot of pvp premades and wpvp events. We will definitely be making the alliance on our server wish they weren't alliance any longer.</p>
        <p>We are looking looking for players that may or may not have experience, but are willing to put in effort to listen and follow direction, and most importantly, here to have a good time, if that fits for you, it fits for us. We aren’t looking for drama as most guilds aren’t.</p>
        <p>We plan on raiding an evening that works for every, most likely Friday and/or Sunday, and maybe a 3rd day.</p>
